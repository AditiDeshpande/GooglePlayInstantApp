Android App Bundle

New publishing format launched in 2018


*Note
In the second half of 2021 , new apps will be required to publish
with the Android App Bundle on Google Play. New Apps larger than 150 MB
must use either Play Feature Delivery or Play Asset Deliver.

An Android App Bundle is a publishing format that includes all
ur app's compiled code and resources , and defers (postpones)
APK generation and signing to Google Play.
Google play uses ur app bundle to generate and serve optimized APKs
for each device config. so only the code and resources needed for a
specific device are downloaded to run ur app. U no longer have to
build , sign , and manage multiple APKs to optimize support for
different devices and users get smaller , more-optimized downloads.

When u use app bundle format to publish ur app , u can also optionally
take advantage of Play Feature Delivery , which allows u to add feature
modules to ur app project. These modules contain features and resources
that u can choose not to include when users first download and
install ur app. Using the play core library ur app later request
to download those modules. Google play will serve only the code and
resources for that module to the device.
